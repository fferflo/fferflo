Welcome! I am a PhD student working at [Fraunhofer Institute of Optronics, System Technologies and Image Exploitation (IOSB)](https://www.iosb.fraunhofer.de/en.html) in cooperation with the [Computer Vision for Human-Computer Interaction Lab (CV:HCI)](https://cvhci.anthropomatik.kit.edu/) at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/) under supervision of [Prof. Rainer Stiefelhagen](https://cvhci.anthropomatik.kit.edu/people.php). I completed my Masters in Computer Science at KIT in 2020 with an emphasis on machine learning and robotics. My current research focuses on [GNSS-free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation) self-localization by exploiting globally available aerial imagery.
